# How to Customize SfDataPager ButtonSize Based on Device Type in .NET MAUI DataPager?
This article explains how to customize the SfDataPager ButtonSize based on the device type in [.NET MAUI DataPager](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.DataGrid.DataPager.SfDataPager.html).

Using the OnIdiom markup extension, you can define different button sizes for desktop and phone devices to provide a responsive and user-friendly paging experience.

## Xaml
```
  <Grid>
     <Grid.RowDefinitions>
         <RowDefinition Height = "*" />
         <RowDefinition Height = "Auto" />
     </Grid.RowDefinitions>
     <Border Grid.Row = "1" Padding = "5">
         <pager:SfDataPager x:Name = "dataPager"
                            ButtonSize="{OnIdiom Desktop=35, Phone=25, Default=40}"
                            ButtonSpacing="10"
                            PageSize = "15" 
                            NumericButtonCount = "10"
                            Source = "{Binding OrderInfoCollection}">
         </pager:SfDataPager>
     </Border>
     <syncfusion:SfDataGrid x:Name = "dataGrid"
                            ColumnWidthMode="Fill"
                            Grid.Row = "0"
                            ItemsSource = "{Binding Source={x:Reference dataPager}, Path=PagedSource}">
     </syncfusion:SfDataGrid>
 </Grid>
```
